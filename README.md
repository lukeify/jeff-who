# Jeff Who?

![Huh?](assets/who.png)

Mostly pointless WebExtension compatible with Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome that replaces "Jeff Bezos" with "Jeff Who?" on most webpages â€” along with a few other easter eggs.

This extension should also support Microsoft Edge & Opera but it has not been tested with these browers. Issues & PRs to fix bugs welcome.
