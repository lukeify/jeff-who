# Jeff Who?

![Huh?](assets/who.png)

Mostly pointless WebExtension compatible with Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome that replaces "Jeff Bezos" with "Jeff Who?" on most webpages — along with a few other easter eggs.

This extension should also support Microsoft Edge, Opera, & Vivaldi but it has not been tested with these browsers. Issues & PRs to fix bugs welcome.

## Installation

### Mozilla Firefox

✅ Mozilla Firefox users can install the signed extension from [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/jeff-who/).

### Google Chrome & Vivaldi

✅ Google Chrome users can install the signed extension from [chrome.google.com/webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jeff-who/iiniimpnoajeiekkfhlpdpcibaahcbpl). Vivaldi users can install from the same location.

### Microsoft Edge

Microsoft requires explicit permission to publish signed extensions in the Edge extension store. For installation instructions on how to install the unsigned extension, please read https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions/guides/adding-and-removing-extensions

The extension has not been published to the Opera extensions repository, however it will be submitted in the future. For installation instructions on how to install the unsigned extension, please read https://dev.opera.com/extensions/testing/

### Safari

At this time Safari does not support WebExtensions.
